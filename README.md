# Football Data Analysis and Prediction ⚽  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing football datasets to gain insights and make predictions about:  
- Player performance  
- Market value  
- Match scores
- etc.

Our goal was to leverage data science techniques to uncover patterns and build predictive models in the context of football analytics.  

## Features  
- **Data Analysis**: Cleaning, exploration, and visualization of football datasets.  
- **Player Performance Prediction**: Models to estimate individual player metrics based on past performance.  
- **Market Value Prediction**: Predicting players' market values using statistical and machine learning techniques.  
- **Match Score Prediction**: Building models to forecast match outcomes.  

## Datasets  
We used publicly available datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores/) . These datasets included information on player statistics, teams, match results, and transfer values.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Modeling**: Regression, Random Forest
